### Description
This project involves two artifacts.<br/>
One is CUI edition, the other is with a GUI, and the GUI is based on JavaFX.<br/>
And that`s why I still use Java in this Kotlin project, but java is just a UI interface in this project.<br/>
The one with GUI is stronger, you only have to choose a file to open, and you can play it.
